# React

- [x] REST HTTP communication: The client must read, update, delete and create a Todo.
- [x] Parent-Child component communication.
- [x] Shared data store/service usage.
- [x] Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- [ ] Testing: Jest or Vitest + DOM-based Testing Library, HTTP mocking: MSW
- [ ] Low-level component testing: A simple but interactive component must have a test suit with good test coverage. The component does not initiate HTTP requests.
- [ ] High-level component testing: The main component (it initiates HTTP requests) must have an example test to demonstrate a successful mocking of the HTTP calls.
