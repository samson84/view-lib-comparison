# Svelte TODO App

## Experience

- Typescript support has [limitations](https://svelte.dev/docs/typescript#limitations)
- With typescript it is easier to learn a new framework. It notifies you in advance a lot of syntax error.
- The compiled code is hard to follow and understand, sourcemaps are needed. Debugger working properly in the browser.
- Component event looks clean and handy, especially with event forwarding.
- The Svelte VSCode Extension provides a great a11y linter. E.g. It notifies if I try to apply an on:click event on a span. It must be a keyboard event too.
