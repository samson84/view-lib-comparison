# Angular TODO App

## Experience

### Documentation

- The new https://anguler.dev looks fancy, but it has a lot of errors, and sometimes the examples are not working.

- The jump into coding approach looks handy. It is easy to try out the basic features of Angular and get familiar with the syntax.

- It is sad, that the complex tutorial can be started in a browser, but the latter features are not implemented in them.

- https://angular.dev misses how to install and start an Angular application. It is only described in https://angular.io. (The tutorial covers this step, but if I want to start quickly an Angular application, I get stuck the first time).

- The documentation looks comprehensive, especially on https://angular.io. The API documentation is obfuscated on https://angular.dev. I especially miss the examples.

- The Proxy config is outdated on anglar.io.

### Framework features

- The angular CLI's generate command looks handy to quickly scaffold components, but it is sometimes not fit to your project.

- angular.json looks complex at first sight.

- Typescript support by default looks pretty nice.

- Unfortunately, the default Angular App (generated by ng new) contains moderate vulnerabilities.

### Compatibility

- The Tailwind install looks seamless.
