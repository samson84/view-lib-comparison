# Angular TODO App

## Experience

### Documentation

- The new https://anguler.dev looks fancy, but it has a lot of errors, and sometimes the examples are not working.

- The jump into coding approach looks handy. It is easy to try out the basic features of Angular and get familiar with the syntax.

- It is sad, that the complex tutorial can be started in a browser, but the latter features are not implemented in them.

- https://angular.dev misses how to install and start an Angular application. It is only described in https://angular.io. (The tutorial covers this step, but if I want to start quickly an Angular application, I get stuck the first time).

- The documentation looks comprehensive, especially on https://angular.io. The API documentation is obfuscated on https://angular.dev. I especially miss the examples.

- The Proxy config is outdated on anglar.io and does not exist on angular.dev.

### Tooling

- The angular CLI's generate command looks handy to quickly scaffold components, but it is sometimes not fit to your project.

- angular.json looks complex at first sight.

- Typescript support by default looks pretty nice.

- Unfortunately, the default Angular App (generated by ng new) contains moderate npm vulnerabilities.

- I got nice type-checking in the templates with the Angular Language Server VSCode extension.

- The Tailwind install was seamless.

### Framework language

- The structural directives like ngIf, ngFor etc look the pain in the ass from a readability point of view. The template built-in control flow blocks a much nicer alternative. Unfortunately, they are in development preview still.

- An Angular component has a lot of boilerplate. According to the style guide it needs at least 3 files. Business logic, template file and styles. If I want to use a component, I have to import it into the ts file, I have to add it to the decorator and finally use its selector in the template.

- The angular style guide recommends a lot of naming conventions to easily identify a lot of elements.

- The service/component separation is a good practice which is supported by default.

- Angular has a lot of concepts: components, services, and directives (3 types), 2 types of module usage (standalone, ngModules), 2 types of templating (ng* directives + built-in control flows), and signals. At first sight, it is too much and creates a too complex system altogether. 

- Angular is moving from one direction to another and the current framework is in between. The new concepts look promising (built-in directives, signals, standalone components).

- It is easy to mess up the code with the directives, especially the structural directives. Importing a directive to a module adds some implicit functionalities to the components, they are sometimes documented poorly and the official API documentation is hard to read.

- The HTTP module with rxJS observables provides a nice and easy way to change the component props according to the HTTP response. Handy error handling, types built in.

## Bottom line

- Angular is a complex system with a lot of built-in functionality and requires a lot of boilerplate code. Angular handles its complexity by tooling (`ng generate`). 

- For me, it is more favorable when a framework tries to create simple concepts and lets the developer decide about the structure, component size and architecture.

- Managing the component size and complexity, and extracting logic to child components is better for me than separating the component into multiple files and approaching the readability this way.
